This app helps you to determine your daily emotional state and mood swing. The principle logic behind it is that like emotions are attached with songs, they are also associated with words (semantic features). This test neither checks your English vocabulary nor does it checks your response speed. After giving a 2 min test, the emotional state graph helps you to determine your emotional state â€“ whether you are under tension(depression) or anxiety(hyper-sensitive). Mood swing graph helps you to determine how much your mood can vary during a day.  
Based on these feedbacks, you can take corrective measures such as visiting a doctor or set your daily life activities such that your days become productive and you stay happy and emotionally healthy.
